# Experiment Scripts and Codes for Online Data Poisoning

This repository contains the experiment scripts, codes and necessary data for ICML 2020 submission of paper "An investigation of Data Poisoning Defenses for Online Learning".

## File/Folder Descriptions

The main folder contains five jupyter notebooks. The "plotting.ipynb" notebook contains the scripts for plotting the figures shown in the paper from result files. The other four notebooks contain scripts that run experiments for different data set. The name of the notebook suggests the data set, i.e. "IMDB.ipynb" for the IMDB sentiment analysis. In order to reproduce the experiment result, one can simply run through all cells in each notebook.

The attacker.py and utils.py contain attacker class and other helper functions used in the scripts.

The data folder contains preprocessed data for the experiments. The result folder contains the experiment results generated by the experiment scripts, and these results will be used for plotting.

## Packages Used

The repository uses pytorch, gensim, numpy, scipy and sklearn.
